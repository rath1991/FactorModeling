# Factor Modeling
* Implement PCA based risk model and get factor betas 
* Used this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors which are evaluated using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. 
*  Optimized the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. 
*  For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.
